# Advent Of Code 2023

## Day 1:

The first part of the problem felt like a perfect introduction to Advent of Code with a quick, fun and not to challening problem,
but then the second part hit and it ramped up hard.
I immediatly googled c# string to find out any comparision trick to use and I ended up finding the IndexOf and LastIndexOf methods.
From there I had to carefully craft the right variables needed and remade the if statements plenty of times until it finally worked.
While this problem was harder then I expected from a day 1 problem I left the first problem with two new methods in my arsenal of knowledge.

## Day 2:

The second day was another day of indexing strings with alot of trial and error. I am getting better at debugging and changing around numbers
but I don't feel like I can visuallise indexes in substrings easy yet.
All in all day 2 felt easier since it builded on my answer and understanding from day 1.
