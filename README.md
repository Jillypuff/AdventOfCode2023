# Advent Of Code 2023

## Day 1:

The first part of the problem felt like a perfect introduction to Advent of Code with a quick, fun and not to challening problem,
but then the second part hit and it ramped up hard.
I immediatly googled c# string to find out any comparision trick to use and I ended up finding the IndexOf and LastIndexOf methods.
From there I had to carefully craft the right variables needed and remade the if statements plenty of times until it finally worked.
While this problem was harder then I expected from a day 1 problem I left the first problem with two new methods in my arsenal of knowledge.

## Day 2:

The second day was another day of indexing strings with alot of trial and error. I am getting better at debugging and changing around numbers
but I don't feel like I can visuallise indexes in substrings easy yet.
All in all day 2 felt easier since it builded on my answer and understanding from day 1.

## Day 3:

I didn't have that much time but I tried... and failed. I think I had a dream about a smart way to approach it but it was to late.
Might come back to it later if I have time.

## Day 4:

Once again I don't have that much time but now I atleast completed the first one.
I used chatgpt to turn one of my method into a linq statement for practice but the logic was the same as the one I wrote before.
I try to do everything myself first and just use chatgpt to make my code fancy, and not to help me solve the problems.
I'm not going to atempt the second because I have to go to bed now, but it looks doable so I might come back tomorrow and see if I can finish this.
