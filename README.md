# Advent Of Code 2023

## Day 1:

### The first part of the problem felt like a perfect introduction to Advent of Code with a quick, fun and not to challening problem.
But then the second part hit and it ramped up hard.
I immediatly googled c# string to find out any comparision trick to use and I ended up finding the IndexOf and LastIndexOf methods.
From there I had to carefully craft the right variables needed and remade the if statements plenty of times until it finally worked.
While this problem was harder then I expected from a day 1 problem I left the first problem with two new methods in my arsenal of knowledge.
